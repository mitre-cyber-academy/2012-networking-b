  I done found myself [this awful old pile of bits](http://$static_file_server/nb-dc65bd97552846bd9aa2c1dbc18404d6/challenge.pcap) and I just donâ€™t know what to do with none of them. Perhaps you could find a body to help me with this and we could set down for a good ol' time. What do you say about that?
